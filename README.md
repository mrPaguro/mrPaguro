<p>
	👋 Hey there, I'm Dan B. from Sao Paulo, Brazil! Welcome to my GitHub space where I play around with code, share cool projects, and learn new things in the tech world.
</p>

<h3>🚀 What I'm About:</h3>

<p>
  I'm on a journey of discovery, transitioning from building homes to building code. From Python scripts to web scraping and diving into the world of machine learning, my journey is all about exploring the exciting possibilities that tech offers.
</p>

<h3>🛠️ What You'll Find Here:</h3>

<p>
  This is where I store my projects – like my <a href="https://github.com/mrpaguro/Pomodoro-Timer">Pomodoro Timer</a> for Linux Terminal or my <a href="https://github.com/mrpaguro/Billboard-100-Web-Scraping">Billboard 100 Web Scraping</a> experiment. Each project is like a piece of a puzzle, showcasing how I tackle problems and build solutions.
</p>

<h3>🎓 Always Learning:</h3>

<p>
  Currently studying Computer Science at the University of the People, I'm sharing my learning journey here. Think of it as a learning journal where you can see me grow and adapt to the ever-changing tech landscape.
</p>

<h3>🤝 Let's Chat:</h3>

<p>
  Whether you're here to explore, learn, or collaborate, I'm all ears! Feel free to look around, ask questions, or even suggest projects. Let's connect and learn from each other. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:mr_paguro@protonmail.com">mr_paguro@protonmail.com</a>

<h3>🍤 Why MrPaguro?</h3>

<p>
  Now, you might be wondering about the name "MrPaguro." Well, it's a fun story! "Paguro" is Italian for hermit crab, those cool little creatures that carry their homes on their backs. I chose it because, like them, I've been on a journey of finding and adapting to new homes – from construction projects to coding projects. So, here's to embracing change and carrying the spirit of exploration, just like MrPaguro!
